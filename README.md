# Jax2D
Jax2D is a simple 2D rigid-body physics engine written entirely in [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) and based off the [Box2D](https://github.com/erincatto/box2d) engine.
Unlike other JAX physics engines, Jax2D is dynamic with respect to scene configuration, allowing heterogeneous scenes to be parallelised with `vmap`.
Jax2D was initially created for the backend of the [Kinetix](https://github.com/FLAIROx/Kinetix) project and was developed by Michael_{[Matthews](https://github.com/MichaelTMatthews), [Beukman](https://github.com/Michael-Beukman)}.

# Basic Usage


# Installation
```commandline
git clone https://github.com/MichaelTMatthews/Jax2D.git
cd Jax2D
pip install -r requirements.txt -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
pre-commit install
```
